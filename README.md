# A demo with Progress bars in React Js


##Tools/Libraries used :

React Js for ui framework

Webpack for bundling

Jest for testing

Axios for ajax calls

##Notes
All UI Components except are dumb, which gets all its data via props. ProgressBarControl component acts as the container components 
which encapsulates all child components and manages the state (this can be useful to later move the state transitions to a library like redux).
